## GitLab

Week 1 was about getting you (a little bit) up to speed with git. 

* Let's have a look in GitLab and see who's joined the group...  
  [Group Members](https://gitlab.une.edu.au/groups/cosc220-2018/-/group_members)

---

## Joining a feature group

1. Put your name on the wiki page:  
  [https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2018/classproject/wikis/groupFormation](https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2018/classproject/wikis/groupFormation)

2. Link your group title to a page for your group

---

## Etiquette:

* Assume you **can** join a group. Don't ask-and-wait for approval. Join first, ask second.

* If you had intended to form a group with your friends, and someone else joins, *and* you would prefer they didn't
  then *politely explain it to them over email*. They are not required to move, but usually will.

* If you later withdraw from the unit, let your team-mates know, and remove your name from the wiki page

---

## General advice

* Join a group *early*. If you leave it late, you're going to be joining a group that tends to leave things late...

* Introduce yourselves *early*.

* Describe your skills to your group-mates *early*.

---

## General advice (2)

* Not everything in a team is code, eg:

  * design skills
  * handling communication with other groups

* But expect to do some code

* Never go silent

---

## Group communication

* Most groups will find their own way to communicate internally, eg:

  * private slack channel
  * Google Hangouts
  * Skype
  * Discord...

* Anything *any other* groups might need to see should go on the project Slack or the forums

---

## Design committee

* I'm going to try to give some shape to the project, but need to avoid being a bottle-neck

* The groups have the freedom to shape the project

* Discuss cross-feature issues on the #designcommittee channel on Slack

* *If there are unresolvable disagreements* message me

---

## Some caveats on ideas you don't wish to share

* In this unit, others *will see your ideas*.

* The project idea is related something I'm working on for research separately. (If you're interested in helping with that, let me know after the unit.)

---

## Some caveats on ideas you don't wish to share


* Your *ideas* are not protected -- everyone else in the class will see them, not under NDA.

* The project *might* decide to open source the end-product (expurgating the names of anyone who wants not to be involved)

If you wish to keep something commercially in confidence, don't implement it in this unit.

## Issue tracking

* How we know what everyone else is working on:  
  [https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2018/classproject/issues](https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2018/classproject/issues)

--

* Let's look at it as a kanban board

--

* Linking commits with issues

--

* `Enhancement` tag

--

* On your wiki page...

---

## Gradle multi-project

* This week, you'll be introduced to gradle. But let's jump ahead!

* Demo.

* Artifactory -- a library repository. [http://hopper.une.edu.au/artifactory](http://hopper.une.edu.au/artifactory)
