## COSC220 exam guide

---

* Distributed version control 

  - lots of detail. You've been working with this all term...

---

* Build systems

  - what does it do?

  - how can things fail?

---

* Scenario questions

  - it's all broken. Tell me how you'd investigate fixing it. What systems will tell you what?

---


* Design question

  - usually the largest question on the exam, but in parts

  - identifying patterns

  - class diagram, statechart, sequence diagram, use case diagram

---

* Agile development

  - in general. Iterating. User stories. Story points. 

  - Scrum and Kanban.  What's a sprint? What's a backlog?  What's a burndown chart?

---

* Continuous deployment

  - you won't need to write any Ansible, but you should know what it is, that you can write it, and how you'd set up a continuous deployment chain

---

* Thinking on your feet

  - suppose you were worried about X. Suggest two ways you could deal with that, and how you might see if they were successful.
