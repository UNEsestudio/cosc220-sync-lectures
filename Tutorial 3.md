## Tutorial 3 -- the project vision is up

This week, a brief [class project vision](https://echo360.org.au/media/dd8d001d-00c6-4276-9b44-05d25d4109d8/public) has been released, and the focus of the tutorial is on getting your group thinking about what feature it would like to implement.

I would like you to create a ticket on GitLab for your group's first feature as soon as possible. By Tuesday! It doesn't need to be polished or complete -- develop it in public rather than planning it in private.

(Otherwise you might do all your planning and then discover that another group is planning the same thing.)

### Ensure you are in a team

* Check the [Group formation page](https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2020/classproject/-/wikis/group-formation) on the GitLab Wiki to see that you are in the right group. If not, tell the unit coordinator!

### Ensure you have access to the class repository

* Check that you have access to the cosc220-2020 group on GitLab

  You should be able to see this by visiting https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2020/
  
  If you do not yet have access, let the unit coordinator know (preferably by pressing the "Request access" button)
   
### Create a ticket on GitLab

On the GitHub repository, go to `Issues` and create a new issue. Roughly describe what you are planning to do, and tag the feature with your group name.

https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2020/classproject/issues

**Don't wait** until you've finished planning your task. Put the ticket up as soon as you have even the vaguest idea of what you'd like to do. You can refine it later, but putting your ticket up earmarks what you would like your team to develop (so we don't get multiple teams trying to do exactly the same feature).

The beginnings of the code is now visible in the repository, though there will be some updates in the next few days.

If you want to check it out and try it

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.une.edu.au:cosc220-2020/classproject.git
cd classproject
```

It is a gradle project, but it's a *multi-module* gradle project. The [readme file](https://gitlab.une.edu.au/cosc220-2020/classproject/-/blob/master/README.md) for the project has some more information on this.
