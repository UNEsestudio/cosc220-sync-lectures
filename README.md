# cosc220-sync-lectures

This is a collection of remark.js slide decks from Software Development Studio 2, circa 2016-2020.

It's not all of the talks or tutorials, just some that were written using remark.js. They are pushed to GitHub as a demonstration of GitHub Pages for a teaching and learning symposium.

The site is also published to GitHub Pages, [https://unesestudio.github.io/cosc220-sync-lectures](https://unesestudio.github.io/cosc220-sync-lectures). 
At the moment, the pages site is published directly off the main branch (there is no build system for the PlantUML diagrams included, for instance).

In future, I'll be shifting more materials to use [Doctacular](https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful/#/pages/doctacular-intro) instead.
